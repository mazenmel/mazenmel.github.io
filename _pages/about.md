I have a Ph.D. in image processing and computer vision from the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Padova, under the supervision of Prof. [Pietro Zanuttigh](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=xk2N2wkAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao) @ the [M3DIA Lab](https://medialab.dei.unipd.it/) (formerly LTTM). I am interested in signal processing and optimization, particularly topics related to imaging. I obtained a First Cycle degree in Physics and Technology in 2016, followed by an Engineering degree in Telecommunications from the Higher School of Communications of Tunis (Sup'Com) in Tunisia in 2019. Additionally, I hold an M.Sc. degree in ICT from the University of Padova, awarded in 2021.

My research focuses on computational photography, camera optics, and computer vision, encompassing both low- and high-level vision sensing problems. Specifically, I have worked on holographic and phase imaging, hyperspectral imaging, monocular depth estimation, and semantic image segmentation. Throughout my Ph.D., I collaborated with the Sony Europe B.V. Technology Center in Stuttgart, and I supervised multiple M.Sc. students in both academic and industry settings.
