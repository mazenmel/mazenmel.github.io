I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Padova, I am interested in signal processing and optimization topics, particularly those related to imaging. I obtained a First Cycle degree in Physics and Technology in 2016, followed by an Engineering degree in Telecommunications from The Higher School of Communications of Tunis (Sup'Com) in Tunisia, which I obtained in 2019. In addition, I hold a M.Sc. degree in ICT from the University of Padova in 2021. My research focuses on computational photography, camera optics, and computer vision, encompassing both low- and high-level vision sensing problems. Specifically, I have worked on holographic and phase imaging, hyper-spectral imaging, monocular depth estimation, and semantic image segmentation. Throughout my Ph.D., I have collaborated with the technology center of Sony Europe B.V. in Stuttgart and I supervised multiple M.Sc. students both in academia and in industry.
